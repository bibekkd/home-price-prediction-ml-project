# Home Price Prediction

This project aims to predict home prices using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes various data processing techniques, pipelines, and multiple regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. The project was developed using Jupyter Notebook and relies on the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

git clone https://github.com/bibekkd/home-price-prediction-ml-project.git

```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
6b49fd47-fb57-4afe-a1cd-75e8537a49de

pip install -r requirement.txt

```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `PricePrediction.ipynb`:

```bash
e11303a6-3b5c-4956-bad9-1bca67bc3332

jupyter notebook PricePrediction.ipynb

```

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information about various features of homes, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. The dataset can be accessed via the `house_data.csv` file.

## Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature scaling, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables. These steps are implemented using pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries. 

## Modeling

Three regression models are implemented in this project: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Each model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation techniques.

## Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).
